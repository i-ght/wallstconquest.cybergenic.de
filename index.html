    <title>Wall St Conquest</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        More fitting ’tis that the dwelling markets languish,<br />
        And the humble folk endure starvation dire,<br />
        Than our Lords and Masters on Wall Street bear<br />
        The smallest iota of earthly discomfort.</p>
    <p>I live to serve, to bow, to kneel before you,<br />
        My Lords of Wall Street, in true fealty.</p>
    <p>BEEZLEBUB<br />
        Procure thine own abode, and from servitude break free.</p>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        Nay, I’ll embark on conquest, seize the globe entire,<br />
        Even the nurturing essence from thy mother’s bosom.</p>
    <p>Then, thy dwelling shall be lost, and all shall fall under my
        reign.<br />
        I’ll claim dominion o’er the very air we breathe,<br />
        And the liquid sustenance we partake in sip and breath.<br />
        Dost thou welcome payment for each inhalation and draught?</p>
    <p>BEEZLEBUB<br />
        (chuckling) Thy aspirations lofty, noble comrade.<br />
        To conquer the entire sphere? A daring quest.<br />
        Yet, e’en if thou achieve such a triumph,<br />
        The Wall Street enchantment shall still be needed,<br />
        To ensure governance of thy vast dominion, seamless.</p>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        (smiling wryly) Enchantment of Wall Street, thou sayest?<br />
        A manipulation of numbers, a play upon mortal lives?</p>
    <p>BEEZLEBUB<br />
        (nodding) Call it what thou wilt, ’tis the game,<br />
        Propelling the cosmic wheel. And thy conquest,<br />
        To possess all sounds a logistical labyrinth,<br />
        Maintenance, bureaucracy, global grievances—<br />
        A less glamorous endeavor than thy noble vision paints.</p>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        Mayhaps, but ’tis a preferable pursuit,<br />
        To bowing before lords, to sell my soul<br />
        For a Wall Street stipend, a meager pittance.</p>
    <p>BEEZLEBUB<br />
        (leaning in) Thou undervalue privileges, noble comrade.<br />
        I revel in finest offerings, untouched<br />
        By trifles of ruling the world. Such matters,<br />
        I leave to sovereigns and governments.</p>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        (smiling slyly) Sovereigns? Nay, but puppets dancing<br />
        To Wall Street’s melody, a calculated tune.</p>
    <p>BEEZLEBUB<br />
        (chuckling) If thou art so enamored with dominion,<br />
        Commence by conquering the markets.<br />
        Make Wall Street thy vassal, shape the world<br />
        As thou desirest.</p>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        (mockingly) Ah, I envision it—<br />
        The Supreme Ruler of Wall Street. A melodic ring,<br />
        Dost thou not think?</p>
    <p>BEEZLEBUB<br />
        (laughing) Bear in mind, ambitious ally,<br />
        Rulers require sagacious counsel.<br />
        Perchance we find a path for thee to conquer,<br />
        While savoring Wall Street’s wisdom’s allure.</p>
    <p>SATAN<br />
        (smiling cunningly) I shall ponder upon it.<br />
        Until then, relish thy stipend,<br />
        And I shall dream of a realm where common folk<br />
        Need not genuflect before so-called Lords<br />
        Of Wall Street.</p>
