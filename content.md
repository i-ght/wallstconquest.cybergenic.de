SATAN  
More fitting 'tis that the dwelling markets languish,  
And the humble folk endure starvation dire,  
Than our Lords and Masters on Wall Street bear  
The smallest iota of earthly discomfort.  
  
I live to serve, to bow, to kneel before you,  
My Lords of Wall Street, in true fealty.  
  
BEEZLEBUB 
Procure thine own abode, and from servitude break free.  
  
SATAN  
Nay, I'll embark on conquest, seize the globe entire,  
Even the nurturing essence from thy mother's bosom.  
  
Then, thy dwelling shall be lost, and all shall fall under my reign.  
I'll claim dominion o'er the very air we breathe,  
And the liquid sustenance we partake in sip and breath.  
Dost thou welcome payment for each inhalation and draught?  
  
BEEZLEBUB 
(chuckling) Thy aspirations lofty, noble comrade.  
To conquer the entire sphere? A daring quest.  
Yet, e'en if thou achieve such a triumph,  
The Wall Street enchantment shall still be needed,  
To ensure governance of thy vast dominion, seamless.  
  
SATAN  
(smiling wryly) Enchantment of Wall Street, thou sayest?  
A manipulation of numbers, a play upon mortal lives?  
  
BEEZLEBUB 
(nodding) Call it what thou wilt, 'tis the game,  
Propelling the cosmic wheel. And thy conquest,  
To possess all sounds a logistical labyrinth,  
Maintenance, bureaucracy, global grievances—  
A less glamorous endeavor than thy noble vision paints.  
  
SATAN  
Mayhaps, but 'tis a preferable pursuit,  
To bowing before lords, to sell my soul  
For a Wall Street stipend, a meager pittance.  
  
BEEZLEBUB 
(leaning in) Thou undervalue privileges, noble comrade.  
I revel in finest offerings, untouched  
By trifles of ruling the world. Such matters,  
I leave to sovereigns and governments.  
  
SATAN  
(smiling slyly) Sovereigns? Nay, but puppets dancing  
To Wall Street's melody, a calculated tune.  
  
BEEZLEBUB 
(chuckling) If thou art so enamored with dominion,  
Commence by conquering the markets.  
Make Wall Street thy vassal, shape the world  
As thou desirest.  
  
SATAN  
(mockingly) Ah, I envision it—  
The Supreme Ruler of Wall Street. A melodic ring,  
Dost thou not think?  
  
BEEZLEBUB 
(laughing) Bear in mind, ambitious ally,  
Rulers require sagacious counsel.  
Perchance we find a path for thee to conquer,  
While savoring Wall Street's wisdom's allure.  
  
SATAN  
(smiling cunningly) I shall ponder upon it.  
Until then, relish thy stipend,  
And I shall dream of a realm where common folk  
Need not genuflect before so-called Lords  
Of Wall Street.
